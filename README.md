# 2048-Game
This project involves the creation of a Python-based 2048 game, a popular single-player puzzle game. The objective of the game is to combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the tile with the number 2048. The game features a text-based user interface and key-based controls for tile movement.
